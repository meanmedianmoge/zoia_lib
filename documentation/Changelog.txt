Version 1.4 (December 2024)
New Features
- New modules were added (Reverse Delay, Univibe), so the app now includes those in the Visualizer and Expander views.
- Patches on PS may now be modified using PUT requests through the API. # TODO
- Updated Sequencer module block logic for new options.
- The Local Storage and Folder tabs now sort by latest download by default.

Fixes
- Adjusted behavior of SD card export if multiple patches share the same slot number.
- Version History imports no longer add empty patch files.
- Removed numpy requirement.

Version 1.3.2 & 1.3.1 (November 2024)
Fixes
- Removed bs4 requirement for html parsing, using API instead.
- Fixed a bug with the data.json format, related to page counts in the API return.
- Fixed an issue with downloading samples from zipped patches.
- Bumped versions of various libraries.

Version 1.3 (January 2024)

New Features
- Updated the PatchStorage API endpoint to coincide with their new beta version.
    - This provides the additional ability to upload patches to the PatchStorage site!
    - Currently, only newly user-imported patches will be able to be uploaded.
    - It requires an active PS account and credentials - this information is only used to authenticate a user-token for enabling POST requests.
    - Further improvements and additions will be coming in future versions.
- New modules were added (Sampler, Logic Gate), so the app now includes those in the Visualizer and Expander views.
- Added a dedicated "Samples" folder in the backend to store and reference saved samples from downloaded or imported patches.
    - When exporting patches that utilize samples, those files will also be exported to the SD card.
- Edited the Expander actions to make them easier to use.
    - Moving around the patch only requires a mouse click + drag (opposed to Alt + click + drag).
    - Disabled the ability to accidentally remove connections.
    - Updated some key-command shortcut actions.
- Added the export directory path to the saved preferences file.
    - It will default to the last used path for the session.
- Adjusted the version import process to be simpler for management of ZOIA folder banks.
    - When importing as a Version History, no checks are made against local or PS data, and it is uploaded fully as-is.
    - Importing multiple or individual patches with the same name will continue to create a Version History.
- Added a check-for-update procedure to retrieve the latest app version from Github.
- Upgraded backend UI to Pyside6.

Fixes
- Fixed a couple crashes related to error dialog.
- Fixed an issue with importing renamed patches.
- Fixed an issue with deleting patches from local.
- Fixed an issue with the export directory path on Windows.
- Rewrote decompression steps for zipped patches.
- Fixed some issues with confirmation windows not confirming the decision.
- Resolved some API issues with the PatchStorage team.

Known Issues
- With the old alpha API endpoint being phased out, older versions of the application will no longer support PS-related functions.
- Feedback loops/recursive patches will not fully show within the Expander.
    - This is due to complexities with the auto-layout algorithm and to avoid crashes.

Future Plans
- Optimize the Patch Expander with a new layout algorithm, variable views, and other useful features.
- Continue development on patch editing and creation tools.
- Support PUT requests for making updates to patches hosted on PS.

Version 1.2 (March 2022)

New Features
- Added a Patch Expander view, which displays the full routing of a given patch in a separate UI window:
    - This is accessed by selecting a patch in the Local Storage tab and clicking “Expand” (next to the page +/- and clear buttons).
    - Routing goes from left to right, is color-coded, and shows all connections.
    - You can adjust the auto-layout, move modules and connections around, and save the resulting graph for future reference.
- With the release of the ZOIA Euroburo (Zebu), new modules were added, so the app now supports those.
    - This resolves any issues with viewing, importing, and exporting any patches that originated on Zebu.
- Thanks to an API update, PS tab author search and sort is now possible.
- Table views are now automatically refreshed upon new patch download, import, and deletion.
    - This avoids needing to re-enter a tab or hit enter in the search bar to force a refresh.
- Added support for importing zipped files.
- You can now sort within Version Histories: default is descending version number.
- Updated the module index to reflect a few firmware changes.
- Included the option to sort tables by Tags and Categories.
- Added a menu option and shortcut to navigate to the app's local backend.
- Improved message text and UI display.

Fixes
- Fixed an issue where a user could not connect to PS even with internet access.
- Fixed an issue with fetching PS patches (only the recent 100 would show once 1k patches were uploaded to the site).
- Fixed an issue with the Update Patches function where it would fail without warning.
- Fixed an issue with the PS web-scraper related to urllib (Windows).
- Fixed an issue with SD folder selection and exporting.
- Fixed an issue when trying to import a patch into a Version History.
- Fixed an issue related to creating new versions of a patch (would cause Folders to index the wrong file).
- Fixed an issue with sorting related to Version Histories.
- Fixed an issue with the theme toggle, also updated CSS for Windows for better contrast in dark mode.
- Fixed an issue with the Local splitter not snapping to default values on startup (Mac).
- Fixed an issue where deleting all besides one patch in a Version History would disable the back button.
- Fixed an issue related to patch deletion (file would remain due to an error).
- Fixed a minor issue with the Visualizer (updated module index option positions).
- Re-resolved issues with compiling the app (Big Sur).

Known Issues
- Feedback loops/recursive patches will not fully show within the Expander.
    - This is due to complexities with the auto-layout algorithm.
    - Optimizations will be coming in the next version.

Future Plans
- Further optimize the Patch Expander with variable views and other useful features.
- Continue development on patch editing and creation tools.

Version 1.1 (July 2021)

New Features
- The visualizer panel has received a few upgrades, including:
    - Calculate and display the correct number of blocks per module.
    - List the actual parameter names, with their values scaled from 0 to 1.
    - Adjust the connection text to be more readable.
    - Include cport connections in the patch-level information display.
    - Show the correct number of pages and restrict the page incrementer from going beyond that number.
    - Add a reset button to zoom out of a module-view (displays the patch-level data in the text window without needing to change pages).
- Local patches can be rated on a scale of 0-5 stars.
    - This feature also includes a new sorting and filtering method, found in the Sort toolbar.
    - The first time you run v1.1 may take a bit longer than usual, since each patch downloaded or imported needs a new rating field.
- Patches now include a direct link to their entry on PatchStorage, if applicable.
- The app is now versioned properly so that you no longer need to delete your saved preferences before upgrading.
- Versioned patches display their patch name instead of the filename, for simplicity.
- Version histories can be exported as a group using the “Export Patches” button in Local Storage.
    - The original functionality (individual exports of versions) still exists in the version history view.
- The export directory (used for exports from Local Storage) is user-definable, using the new “Set Export Directory” button in the SD Card tab.
    - If you do not define a directory, the default remains as “to_zoia”.
- The export patch dialog will default to the next open slot in the directory chosen.
    - If you attempt to overwrite, it will display the name of the patch currently there.
- Folder exports will automatically fill empty slots with blank patches.
- The patch import dialog has been updated to display the name of the patch(es) which failed to import.
- ZOIA got an update, so the app will reflect those changes during binary decoding.
- UI updates, including:
    - Tooltip and status tip text.
    - Shortcut keymaps.
    - Default panel sizes.
    - Button names and style.
    - Pop-up message detail.
- General code upkeep: applied a fancy auto-formatter to the codebase and automated the app-bundling process.

Fixes
- Underlying patch decoding code has been fixed to reflect block positions and versioned modules.
- The (old) Banks tab and all references to a “bank” have been replaced with the term “Folder” to avoid confusion.
- Fixed an issue where dependency issues were causing the app to not load (Mac).
- Fixed an issue where new patches wouldn't load upon tab switch (credit to Elipses22).
- Fixed an issue where choosing an SD card from the SD tab would cause the UI to snap to the Local Storage tab (credit to smithrobs).
- Fixed an issue where temp directories would overwrite the patch list in the Local Storage tab, causing it to appear like you had no patches downloaded.
- Fixed an issue where an error in loading a patch from a saved Folder would cause all subsequent Folder slots to be empty.
- Fixed an issue where local exports would not function due to an improper SD location.
- Fixed an issue with setting the SD card location from the Folders tab.
- Fixed an issue where documentation would not show on the PS tab.
- Mac build is now confirmed to work with the .app file. No more needing to run from the terminal (credit to smithrobs).

Known Issues
- RAR-compressed files cannot be downloaded on Mac (as of this writing, this affects 1 patch - ZOIA Murf v2).
    - Due to RAR’s licensing, we cannot include a version of the compression algorithm, nor can we verify that the user’s machine has the algo installed.
    - A workaround for this is to download the RAR patch(es) separately on PatchStorage, and then import the binary file to the app.

Future Plans
- Fully implement the Patch Expander view and improve its features.
- Provide patch editing and patch creation.

_________________________________________

Version 1.0 (September 25, 2020)

New Features
- Finalized ZOIA binary parsing implementation (massive credit to djigneo/apparent1 for this).
    - As of this release, all features of the patch are fully exposed and can be decoded into a JSON object for further use.
- Patch visualizer has been updated with more information to help you understand patches at a quick-glance.
- Added the ability to search and sort for patches by author name.
    - This applies to Local and Bank tabs only
    - PS tab author search and sort will not be supported at this time due to the API structure.
- Updated patch importing so that patches with near-identical names are merged upon import (instead of strictly identical names).
- Updated the behavior of the SD and Bank tables so that multiples can be selected and moved in different ways:
    - Hold Shift and click the start and end patches to move.
    - Hold Ctrl/Cmd and click on each patch you'd like to move.
- Patches can now be moved into a bank in the following ways:
    - Dragging single or multiple selections (similar options as above) at once.
    - Include an Add to Bank button for single selections at a time.
- Added a Clear Bank button to wipe the bank tables clean.
- Added a new Help toolbar which allows users to access documentation and useful ZOIA resources.
    - These will display in the PS tab browser panel.
    - You can also search for different commands/shortcuts.
- Added a Reset UI menu option in the event that users mangle the UI panels or tables.
- Updated the light theme colors to give it a more muted look.
- Alternating row colors is now a saved preference.
    - It will save whatever is the current setting upon closing the application.
- Added a step-by-step guide for how to compile the application from source for developers, contributors or users who were unable to open the beta builds.
- Added our first Linux build! We aim to support the latest stable version of Ubuntu going forward.
    - If you are a Linux user who prefers other distributions, please contact me.

Fixes
- Fixed an issue that occurred while importing a version history (Mac).
- Removed the threads used with menu action multi-import functions (Mac temporary fix).
- Fixed an issue where the dates of imported patches were back-dated to the history of the SD card.
- Fixed an issue with SD card imported files having mangled filenames (Windows). This also caused patches to not export properly.
- Fixed an issue where changing the font/font size didn't apply to themes or buttons.

Known Issues
- Certain patch binaries cannot be fully decoded due to being saved on deprecated ZOIA firmware.
- Saved UI preferences are not being applied correctly for the Local Storage tab - specifically the vertical splitter (Mac).

Future Plans
- Expansion view of routing for patch visualizer.
    - Right now, the connections are displayed on a module-block level, but not from a general patch level.
    - The expander would provide an in-depth visualization of audio and CV routing, likely to be displayed in a new tab.
- Extend the binary decoder methods into an API for other applications/programs to utilize.
- Simplify and automate code structure for releases (currently, a minimal-working version of the code needs to be created for the app-building process).
- Allow for custom themes/colors in the UI.
- Actually fix threading issues associated with menu action multi-imports.

_________________________________________

Beta 3 (August 7, 2020)

New Features
- Added an early implementation of a patch visualizer. Massive thanks to apparent1 for the initial C#
  implementation, and special thanks to chmjacques and meanmedianmoge for helping with the binary
  analysis. This is a feature that will grow in the future and may eventually turn into a full patch
  editor (absolutely zero promises there).
- The application now works offline! However, you won't be able to access the PatchStorage View tab while
  offline. May require a restart to detect an internet connection.
- Added the ability to download all patches from PatchStorage (via a suggestion from Steve, thanks Steve!)
- Added threading support to processes that would stall the application (such as importing, checking for
  updates, and refreshing the PatchStorage patch list).
- Added some more style tweaks to the Windows version of Beta 3.
- Optimizations to have the Librarian run smoother and better than Beta 2. Take that Beta 2!
  Nobody downloaded you anyway.
- Added the ability to download patches that use the .rar compression algorithm. This will only work if
  you have WinRAR installed on your computer.

Fixes
- Fixed a error that occured when trying to import a version history that contained more than 10 patches
  (thanks chmjacques and meanmedianmoge!)
- Fixed an exporting error that would result in a popup saying an export was successful even if the user
  cancelled out of the export.
- Fixed an isue when the application is launched for the first time and tables would not retain their
  specified sizes.
- Fixed sorting order not being maintained after a search.
- Fixed an issue with Bank saving (it actually works now).
- Remade the logo and splash screen using a clearer ZOIA logo.

Futrue Plans
- Expanding on the patch visualizer with more info, having the length of modules be correctly represented,
  and the ability to view connections between modules.
- Improving the patch preview widget to make it look nicer and not like a giant wall of text.
- Anything else the community wants to see implemented!

_________________________________________

Beta 2 (July 15, 2020)

New Features
- The ZOIA Librarian will now save application settings on close. Did you hate having to resize the tables constantly?
  Probably. Now you just need to resize once and be done with it! Additional settings that are saved include the size
  of the window, the font and font size, the SD card (should it have been specified) and whether dark mode is enabled.
- Speaking of font saving, you can now change the font and font size used throughout the application. Check it out in
  the options menu.
- Also speaking of dark mode, yup, there's a dark mode now. Check it out in the options menu.
  (What do you mean nobody asked for this?)
- Added early support for imported directories to be treated as versions in the ZOIA Librarian.
  More features surrounding this will be included in Beta 3.
- Added some styling to the application to make it less bland.
- Added keyboard shortcuts to all menu items.
- Added the ability to delete items off of an SD card from within the ZOIA Librarian.
- Added a check that will try to detect if a patch you are importing is currently hosted on PatchStorage. If it is,
  the tags, categories, and patch notes will be retrieved when the patch is imported (Thanks Ch3ryl)!
  (note this won't work 100% of the time, the patch must be named the same as the entry on PatchStorage).
- Added the ability to drag/drop multiple patches in the SD card tables and bank tables. Now, organizing banks/sd
  card folders can be done faster than ever!
- Added accessibility text throughout the application.

Fixes
- The "Load Bank" button will not be enabled if there are no banks saved once the user launches the application.
- Fixed the issue where updating the patch notes added a blank line at the start. The update patch notes button
  is sorry. (It's okay update patch notes button, we forgive you).
- Fixed the case where loading/exporting a bank that had a patch that was deleted from the ZOIA Librarian caused
  a crash. Now, a message box will inform the user of such occurances, and in the case of exporting,
  will also specify which patches failed to export.
- Fixed some message boxes failing to display the application logo.
- Fixed the layout of the Bank tab so that the user does not need to drag a patch as far as before to add it to a
  Bank.
- Fixed a bug with the Banks tables where if a user dragged patch and released it between two rows the table would
  occasionally make new phantom rows.
- Fixed an issue with importing where the ### prefix would be imported in the _zoia_ prefix was missing from a patch
  (Thanks markcrosbie!)
- Fixed an issue where if a bank had multiple of the same patch and a user tried to delete the one that occured later
  in the slot list, the wrong patch would be deleted from the bank (currently a Windows only fix).
- Fixed an issue with file names that contained "." in their name before the extension.
- Fixed importing failing if the directory contained any "."s in its name (thanks chmjacques!)
- Fixed an issue where views would be counted multiple times in one session.
- Fixed an error that would "allow" a patch to be exporting even if an SD card was not inserted into the computer.
- Addressed the case where a user deletes the second to last patch in a Version History such that they are now sent
  back to the main local patch overview (thanks meanmedianmoge)!
- Added multiple new popups to confirm when actions have finished processing.

Plans for Beta 3
- Making the application feel a lot more responsive (no more freezing while trying to look for patch updates).
- Adding a patch visualizer (very hush hush right now, please stay tuned).
- Improving the patch preview to have it include images and generally style it more like a website rather than
  a wall of text.
- Some low-level optimizations to make it so the application starts faster.
